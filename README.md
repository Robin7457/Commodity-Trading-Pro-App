## Risk Calculator: Professional Position Sizing

### Account Setup

**Step 1**: Enter your **total trading capital** in the "Account Size" field. This should represent only funds allocated for commodity trading, not your entire savings.[12][25][9]

**Step 2**: Set your **risk percentage per trade** (typically 1-2%). This determines how much you're willing to lose on any single position.[25][9][12]

**Step 3**: The calculator automatically computes your **maximum risk amount** per trade (Account Size √ó Risk Percentage).[9][12][25]

### ATR-Based Position Sizing

**Understanding ATR**: Average True Range measures recent price volatility. Higher ATR indicates more volatile markets requiring wider stops and smaller position sizes.[24][22][23]

**Stop Loss Calculation**:
- **Entry Price - (ATR √ó Multiplier)** for long positions
- **Entry Price + (ATR √ó Multiplier)** for short positions
- **Multiplier Selection**: 1.5-2x for day trading, 2-3x for swing trading, 3-4x for position trading[11][22][9]

**Position Size Formula**:
```
Position Size = Risk Amount √∑ (Entry Price - Stop Loss Price)
```

**Example Calculation**:
- Account: ‚Çπ100,000
- Risk: 2% (‚Çπ2,000)
- Gold Entry: ‚Çπ76,200
- ATR: ‚Çπ890, Multiplier: 2x
- Stop Loss: ‚Çπ76,200 - (‚Çπ890 √ó 2) = ‚Çπ74,420
- Position Size: ‚Çπ2,000 √∑ (‚Çπ76,200 - ‚Çπ74,420) = 1.12 lots[9][11]

### Cost Analysis

The calculator includes **all trading costs**:
- **Brokerage**: Typically ‚Çπ20-50 per lot for commodities[5][3]
- **GST**: 18% on brokerage fees
- **Exchange Charges**: MCX/NCDEX transaction fees
- **Slippage**: Market impact costs (usually 0.1-0.3%)[3][20]
